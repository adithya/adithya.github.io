I have an admission to make, I have long had a slight distaste for companies like Koenigsegg, that is to say, companies that are focused only on pushing the state of the art, as while I greatly appreciate advances in technologies, I find it a bit frustrating just how out of reach that technology is. 

Despite this pretense I can't help but watch this video and forget about all that, its truly incredible the kind of attention to detail, care, and innovation Koenigsegg puts into their cars.
