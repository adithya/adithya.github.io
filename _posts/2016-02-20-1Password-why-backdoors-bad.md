Over the past few months I have been [reading][reading] a [number][number] of [excellent][excellent] articles from Jeffery Goldberg at 1Password. Jeffery has an uncanny ability to clearly explain various topics in cryptography and security, I find his articles a joy to read. 

His latest article is a great explanation of what I affectionality refer to as "the great back door debacle". 

When your done reading that and want to learn more, I encourage you to read through the Jeff's [older][archive] pieces.
