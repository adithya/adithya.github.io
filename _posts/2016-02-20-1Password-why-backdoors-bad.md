Over the past few months I have been [reading][https://support.1password.com/authentication-vs-encryption/] a [number][https://blog.agilebits.com/2016/01/21/when-back-doors-go-bad-mind-your-ps-and-qs/] of [excellent][https://blog.agilebits.com/2015/03/30/bcrypt-is-great-but-is-password-cracking-infeasible/] articles from Jeffery Goldberg at 1Password who effectively explains various topics in cryptography and security. 

His latest article is a great explanation of what I affectionality refer to as "the great back door debacle", if your looking for a solid understanding of the situation, this is a great place to start. 

When your done reading that and want to learn more, make sure to read through the [archive ][https://blog.agilebits.com/author/jeff/] of Jeff's articles.
