Mike Ash with an excellent piece on the technical feasibility of the FBI's request that Apple build a custom OS in order to allow for "backdoor" access to secured iPhones. 

While I found the article to read like I persume a Harry Potter book reads to Harry Potter fans, I can understand if the article is not for everyone. 

However regardless of your interest in the article, I encourage you to acknowledge these two facts in order to protect your iPhone from becoming easily comprimised by brute-force attacks.

>For a four-digit passcode, trying 10,000 combinations at 80 milliseconds each would take less than 15 minutes. A six-digit passcode would take about a day.

These time-frames are void of any failed-attempt time delays which can significantly increase these time-frames[^1]. The simple truth is regardless of what happens with the FBI and Apple, a lengthy and well thought out password will protect you. 

While I can understand the inconvience an eight character alphaneumic password is to individuals with non-TouchID iPhones, if you have an iPhone with TouchID, you have no execuse. 

[^1]: While true the failed-attempt time delays can drastically increase time frames, its a known fact that these time-delays can be circumvented on all iPhones pre-A7 (read:  all iPhones prior to the 5S).
