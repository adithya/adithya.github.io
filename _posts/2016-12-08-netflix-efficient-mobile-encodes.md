For some time now Netflix has been working to ensure optimal information entropy, itâ€™s an area where small improvements can lead to sizeable benefits for both Netflix and its customers. 

>The AVCHi-Mobile streams can deliver the same video quality at 15% lower bitrate according to PSNR and at 19% lower bitrate according to VMAF. The VP9-Mobile streams show more gains and can deliver an average of 36% bitrate savings according to PSNR and VMAF.
