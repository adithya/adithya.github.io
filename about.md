My name is Adithya Sudarsan, and this is my home on the internet, welcome.

Currently I'm studying computer science at the [University of Windsor](http://www.uwindsor.ca). When I'm not doing my homework, you can usually find me working on apps for any one of Apple's platforms. 

Either way whether its school work, or programming, I spend most of time in front of a 15" Retina Macbook Pro, listening to music on my [Senheiser HD280](http://en-us.sennheiser.com/professional-dj-headphones-noise-cancelling-hd-280-pro). 

I really enjoy podcasts, my current favorites are the [Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm), [Under the Radar](https://www.relay.fm/radar), [The Talk Show](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/), [Rocket](https://www.relay.fm/rocket), [Debug](http://www.imore.com/debug), [Less Than or Equal](https://www.relay.fm/ltoe/), [More than Just the Code](http://mtjc.fm), and [Top Four](https://www.relay.fm/topfour). 

When I'm not listening to podcasts or writing code, I'm ogling cars, going on walks, biking, or reading through my [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) queue. 

I'm basically your average off-the-shelf nerd.


#The Site

While I used to write on Tumblr, after finding that to be no longer sufficient for my needs I decided to go a different route. 

My site is now powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static-site/static-blogging engine. I use the standard template with a few imperceptible changes.

I write my posts in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using [TextMate](https://macromates.com). 

My site is hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), because its free, and I heard good things.
